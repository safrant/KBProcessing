Tracy,
  Those are Gilberto's library stuff.
  I didn't touch those two files.
  As long as you have those two files in the correspinding directory, you should
  be able to compile.

I checked these out and the executables look good.  I did notice that the make files refer to an "include ../lib/makefile.head" and "include ../lib/makefile.incl".  If I need to build this for some reason, what would I need to gather?

No hurry.

Thanks,
